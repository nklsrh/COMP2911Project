So far we have accomplished the following:
- I created a GitHub repo
- I added Ryan Tan and Nicholas Ho as collaborators to the repo
- Nicholas and I set up GitHub for Windows; Ryan is using SourceTree
- Ryan has suggested the use of MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for developing this project
- Ryan is also interested in the D3 Javascript library for making graphs (I'm not entirely sure why)
- I am about to begin creating a project log file for committing, this will be edited by the others as well to work as a basis for our development diaries

Have not started any design or code work so far, still working out the Project Management tools
- GitHub is cool but I fear it may not be as productive as DropBox, for example
- Definitely the branch system of Git is useful for coding
- I have uninstalled GitHub for Windows and SourceTree after trying them for a while. TortoiseGit is the best tool I've seen so far: It has context-menus in Explorer, simple oneclick commands and uncluttered interface. Also its not tied only to GitHub
- Nicholas and I have spent the last few days working on our Lab tasks (BFS searches, Strategy patterns) so have not yet begun work on this
- We need to get a move on and decide on who is doing what
