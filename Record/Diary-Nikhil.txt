So far we have accomplished the following:
- I created a GitHub repo
- I added Ryan Tan and Nicholas Ho as collaborators to the repo
- Nicholas and I set up GitHub for Windows; Ryan is using SourceTree
- Ryan has suggested the use of MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for developing this project
- Ryan is also interested in the D3 Javascript library for making graphs (I'm not entirely sure why)
- I am about to begin creating a project log file for committing, this will be edited by the others as well to work as a basis for our development diaries
